# electronic-store-management-java
E-Commerce App - Created by using java, This project controls the modules form Login System, Adding Customer details, Adding New Electronic Item by which user can easily take data of customer.
This project would allow for the computerization of a small business whose main purpose is to keep track of its inventory and information process and to move from a storing information on paper to computer data. The management of electronic store would make it much simpler to store new electronic item data, customer information and purchase details. When the consumer purchase the phone, the detail stored in the databases. You will retrieve the purchase details promptly.
I have given the code to project to database, but how it will connect you have to do it by yourself.
This code will work, so if you don't required don't change code.
